    <h2>Redesign – MPL AG (2025)</h2>
    <p>I'm currently redesigning the website of MPL AG, a Swiss manufacturer of rugged, fanless industrial computers. The goal is to modernize the site while improving usability for a technical audience.
        The new design focuses on clearer navigation, better product accessibility, and a responsive layout that reflects MPL's precision engineering and long-term reliability.
        My role includes UX/UI design, information architecture, programing and visual strategy.</p>
    <p>The redesign is planed to go live in September 2025.</p>

                This project was developed as part of my graduation at SAE Zurich.
                The concept was to design and build a modern, user-friendly web application.
                The app features dynamic content presentation, clean design aesthetics, and a smooth user experience that reflects
                the atmosphere of a real-world gallery space. The goal was to blend technology and creativity, offering users an
                immersive way to explore art online.</p>
